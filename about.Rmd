A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.

Following are some of the statistics about stroke from CDC website

* In 2018, 1 in every 6 deaths from cardiovascular disease was due to stroke.
* Someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds. Every 4 minutes, someone dies of stroke.
* Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes.
* About 185,000 strokes—nearly 1 of 4—are in people who have had a previous stroke.
* About 87% of all strokes are ischemic strokes, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked.
Stroke-related costs in the United States came to nearly $46 billion between 2014 and 2015.2 This total includes the cost of health care services, medicines to treat stroke, and missed days of work.
* Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Stroke reduces mobility in more than half of stroke survivors age 65 and over.


Ther are certain conditions that increase the risk of getting a stroke. The motivation behind this dashboard is to help people understand the risk and take preventive measures *. 

This project is a case study for the course-work "DS501 - Introduction to Data Science" at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Instructors - Narhara Chari Dingari, PhD.

## The Stroke Predictor

The **main conditions** of the analysis are:

* Gender
* Age
* High Blood Pressure
* Heart Disease
* Diabetes
* Obesity
